## Description

Currently working on recieving a certificate in full stack web development from the University of Denver. I was born in Phoenix Arizona but have lived in Salida, CO since I was a kid. I went to school at CU in Boulder for Film and political Science. I've spent most of my career as a mixologist and Bartender helping revamp restaurants cocktail programs. I enjoy learning new things and working with a team to solve problems. With my career in Technology my dream is to work with ski resorts and local companies to provide a better all around local experience when tourists decide to visit.
